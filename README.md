If you want to submit a fix for a typo or fix for code then just submit a pull request, and I'm happy to
recompile the resulting document.

If for some reason you want to compile the HTML page yourself, then you'll need to compile the preprocesor
against Pandoc and then run make to build the page.

```bash
$ make
```

Alternatively a PDF or EPUB file can be generated by one of the following
commands:

```bash
$ make tutorial.pdf
$ make tutorial.epub
```
